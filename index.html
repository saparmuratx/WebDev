        Instead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more directories, 
        which can then be saved in workspaces for future reuse. 
        This allows it to operate as a language-agnostic code editor for any language. 
        It supports many programming languages and a set of features that differ per language. 
        Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from the project tree via settings. 
        Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface 
        but can be accessed via the command palette. The command palette is able to execute 
        virtually every feature the graphical interface supports, making it very 
        keyboard-accessible
